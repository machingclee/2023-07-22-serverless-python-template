- (for conda) To include new dependency, we simply `pip install <the_dependecy_name> && pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
- `sls wsgi serve` to start locally
- select desired layer in [here](https://github.com/keithrozario/Klayers/tree/master/deployments/python3.8). Sometimes lambda does not understand how to handle compiled library that we upload (due to OS difference).
- We add layer in serverless yml, and remove the corresponding dependency in requirement.txt
- `sls plugin install -n serverless-wsgi`
- `sls plugin install -n serverless-python-requirements`
